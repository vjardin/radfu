# Legal Information

## Interoperability and Reverse Engineering Notice (European Union)

RADFU is an open-source project intended to enable interoperability with Renesas RA
microcontrollers by implementing a Device Firmware Update (DFU) communication protocol.

This project is implemented using clean-room reimplementation principles, based on publicly
observable behavior, publicly available documentation, and lawful analysis. No proprietary
source code, firmware, or confidential material from Renesas or any third party is included
in this repository.


## Legal Basis

The development of this project relies on the interoperability exception provided by:

- European Union Directive 2009/24/EC on the legal protection of computer programs,
  Article 6 (Decompilation for interoperability)
- French Intellectual Property Code, Article L122-6-1
  (transposition of Directive 2009/24/EC)

These legal frameworks permit the observation, study, and analysis of a program only to the
extent necessary to achieve interoperability with an independently created program, subject
to strict limitations.


## Scope and Limitations

The following principles apply to this project:

- Reverse engineering, where applicable, was performed solely to achieve interoperability
- The analysis was limited to protocol behavior and interface information strictly required
  for that purpose
- No decompiled or extracted proprietary code is distributed
- Information obtained was not used to create a competing or substantially similar
  proprietary implementation
- This project does not disclose confidential or trade-secret information


## License
